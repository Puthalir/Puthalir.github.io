☁️ Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Overview
🔹 Project
  A project in GCP is a logical container for resources (like APIs, storage, databases).
  
  All billing, access control, and API usage are tied to a specific project.


🔐 Access Control in GCP
🔹 IAM (Identity and Access Management)
Manages who can do what on which resources.

Roles:

  Primitive roles: Basic access (Owner, Editor, Viewer).
  
  Predefined roles: Granular, service-specific roles (e.g., BigQuery Data Viewer, Dialogflow Admin).
  
  Custom roles: You define specific permissions for custom needs.

Service Account:

  A special Google account used by apps or VMs to call GCP services.
  
  Attach to APIs, run services like Cloud Run, or authenticate with Dialogflow.

🔌 API Services and Usage
🔹 Billing Based on Usage
  GCP APIs and services charge based on actual use:
  
  E.g., number of queries, storage used, compute time, etc.
  
  Each project must be linked to a Billing Account to use paid services.

🤖 What is Dialogflow API?
  Dialogflow is Google’s Natural Language Understanding (NLU) platform for building conversational interfaces like chatbots, voice assistants, or IVR systems.
  
  Dialogflow ES (Essentials): Simple agents, easy to use, ideal for basic use cases.
  
  Dialogflow CX (Customer Experience): Advanced agents, suitable for large, complex, multi-turn conversations.
  
  The Dialogflow API allows developers to manage agents, intents, sessions, training data, and detect intent programmatically.
