Problem 

The manager of a factory claims that among his 400 employees.
‾ 312 got a pay rise last year
‾ 248 got increased pension benefits last year
‾ 173 got both pension benefits and pay rise last year
‾ 13 got neither

calculate the probability of.
a)	Getting a pay rise
Probability = 312 / 400 =0.78
b)	Not getting a pay rise
400 – 312 = 88
Probability = 88 / 400 = 0.22
c)	Getting both a pay rise and pension benefits
Probability =173 /400 = 0.432
d)	Getting no pay rise or benefit increase
Probability = 13 / 400 = 0.032
e)	Getting a pay rise or benefits
Probability = (312 + 248 – 173) / 400
= 387 / 400 = 0.967



1.	A production firm has produced 50 films in the past 5 years, directed by a team of 8 directors. Out of these 50 films, 35 became box office hits. 28 films won at least one major film award. 18 films achieved both a hit and won an award. 5 films neither became hits nor won awards.
Calculate the chance that a director picked at random:
a) Had a successful hit.
b) Missed out on a hit.
c) Was both a hit and won an award.
d) Was neither a hit nor won an award.
e) Was either a hit or won an award.
2.	An influencer is reviewing their posts reach and its responses in the past year. She saw 340 posts got at least 100 like 270 posts got at least 20 comments 190 posts got both at least 100 likes and at least 20 comments 40 posts got neither 100 likes nor 20 comments.

Calculate the probability that a randomly picked post:
a) Got at least 100 likes
b) Did not get at least 100 likes
c) Got both at least 100 likes and at least 20 comments
d) Got neither 100 likes nor 20 comments
e) Got either at least 100 likes or at least 20 comments

a) How many households have only a dog?
b) How many have only a cat?
c) How many have neither a dog nor a cat?
d) What is the probability that a randomly chosen household has a dog or a cat?

4.	For a university event 500 students registered for coding workshops 400 students registered for design workshops 250 students registered for both 150 students registered for neither.
Calculate the probability that a randomly picked student:
a) Registered for coding workshops
b) Did not register for coding workshops
c) Registered for both coding and design workshops
d) Registered for neither workshop
e) Registered for at least one workshop


5.	At a food festival 520 visitors tried Indian food 460 visitors tried Mexican food 300 visitors tried both 80 visitors tried neither.
